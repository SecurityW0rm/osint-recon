# Automated OSINT Script

This script automates the process of pulling open-source information.

This can also serve as a template for your own custom reconnaissance needs. 

The script has placeholders for API keys from Shodan, WHOIS, and haveibeenpwned.

Unfortunatley, you will need paid memberships to generate the Shodan and haveibeenpwned API keys.

You do not need a membership for a WHOIS key at the time of writting this.

As stated, customize this script for whatever you need it for.

With the right APIs, you can likely make turn this into a very powerful and versitile information gathering tool.

## Features
- Generates an OSINT report text file and places in on your desktop
- The template on its own can target any domain name, but a tool like Sherlock could allow for social media usernames and email addresses to be targeted as well (currently working on this)

## Requirements

1. Python 3.10 or newer installed on the system
2. Shelock if you want to do some username scraping
